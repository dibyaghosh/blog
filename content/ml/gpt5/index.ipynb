    "This post is the result of an afternoon detour spiraled from a joke over lunch: could one train a LLM with only 5 parameters (in the spirit of [Von Neumann's elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%27s_elephant))? 5 parameters is of course silly,but there's an underlying real concern here: do we really need hundreds of billions of parameters in a language model, or is it just an artifact of how we've learned to train deep models? A lot of serious work has been done in earnest to study this question, including on model distillation, sparse pruning, quantization, low-rank adaptation, and more. But this blog post is just a quick look at some more light-hearted approaches.\n"

Instead, we'll try to reparameterize the same large transformer architecture, just with fewer trainable parameters.\n",

One way to reduce the number of trainable parameters is [LoRA](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/main/en/conceptual_guides/lora), which splits this parameter into a random initialized (and fixed) matrix $W_{frozen}$ and a learned low-rank approximation $AB$.\n",

    "### FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What are the advantages of this basis parameterization?** Honestly, not much. It's harder to implement, slower, and less performant. The one main advantage is that the memory footprint of the model is much smaller, since the exemplar weights $\\mathbf{W}_{frozen}^k$ never need to be stored anywhere -- they can be generated on-the-fly when requested so long as your hold onto the rng seed. (there's a caveat to this, see [Parameter scaling](#parameter-scaling) below). For most real cases where you're not trying to squeeze into < 1000 params, LoRA is practical and better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Is basis parameterization the same as LoRA?** No, but it's subtle. This method optimizes over a low-rank subspace of the parameter space, and LoRA optimizes over the space of low-rank functions. LoRA forces the learned embeddings to a lower-dimensional representation, and then up-projects them to the full space. This method always keeps the embeddings in the original space, so in theory if we kept the number of trainable parameters the same, this method should be more expressive. Check the figure above for a visual view.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What might have gone wrong?** In this low-parameterization regime, it seems the method is a little fickle to how the linear combination was instantiated (e.g. how is $\\alpha_i$ initialized, how is each $\\mathbf{W}_{frozen}^i$ initialized). I didn't have time to investigate this further, but I suspect that this is the main reason why the 5-parameter model failed to learn anything, and why the 5-parameters-per-layer model performed poorly as well."

This is fine if $d=5$, but what if we want to scale this up to $d=1000$? For each dense layer in GPT2, this would be initializing 2B parameters! This is a non-starter!\n",

    "OK, so we can't train a language model with 5 parameters.  And also not with 1000 parameters. Or with 1M parameters. It's pretty cool how far we can get though at all with such few parameters -- I think it's a testament to how powerful the Transformer function class is, that even optimizing such a small set of parameters can model language to some degree. \n",
    "\n",
    "These ideas are of course more practical and useful in the finetuning regime: instead of doing low-rank perturbations on a random initialization, to do it on a good pre-trained base. Instead of doing an interpolation between random matrices, to do it between good (different) pre-trained bases. This is the focus of more serious research, not an afternoon's whimsy.\n",
